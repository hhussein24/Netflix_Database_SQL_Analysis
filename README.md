# Netflix_Database_SQL_Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate my expertise in SQL by analyzing Netflix's content library using advanced database queries and analytical techniques. Through this analysis, I showcase:

âœ… SQL Proficiency â€“ Implementing CRUD operations, filtering, aggregation, and complex analytical queries to extract meaningful insights.
âœ… Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Utilizing functions like UNNEST(), STRING_TO_ARRAY(), and SPLIT_PART() to structure and clean raw data effectively.
âœ… Analytical Thinking â€“ Identifying key trends in content production, actor appearances, and content categorization to provide strategic insights.
âœ… Advanced SQL Functions â€“ Leveraging window functions (RANK()), CTEs (WITH), date conversions (TO_DATE()), and conditional logic (CASE) to enhance data analysis.
âœ… Business-Relevant Insights â€“ Extracting valuable information on content distribution, ratings, and market trends, aligning data findings with business decision-making.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights using SQL, making it a strong addition to my data analytics portfolio. ðŸš€
